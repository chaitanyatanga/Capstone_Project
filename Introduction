Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada.The city is known for being the most multicultural in the world. One way to get to know the city and its people is through different ethnic foods.

In this project we will try to understand the diversity of a neighborhood by leveraging venue data from Foursquare’s ‘Places API’ and ‘k-means clustering’ machine learning algorithm. 
This study would be aimed at stakeholders who are interested to use this quantifiable to understand the distribution of different cultures and cuisines in Toronto,this project can also be utilized by food vendors who are willing to open a new restaurant.
